## How to use

As it sits currently, clone the repository, and enter the commad 'flask run'

Dependancies: Python, flask, Browser(for previewing web app)

Also 'flask run --host=0.0.0.0' will broadcast the app to the local network allowing other devices to connect as will be important when we want to add multi-player functionality.
